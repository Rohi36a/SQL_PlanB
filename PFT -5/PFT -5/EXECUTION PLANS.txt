EXECUTION PLANS:

	THESE ARE XML BASED REPRESENTATIONS THAT GIVES US THE INFORMATION ON THE QUERY EXECUTION STATISTICS.

			DURATION
			TYPE OF EXECUTION  : TABLE SCAN		INDEX SCAN	INDEX SEEK
			AMOUNT OF CPU USAGE
			AMOUNT OF MEMORY USAGE
			THE NUMBER OF ROWS INVOLVED
			THE AMOUNT OF DATA INVOLVED OVER NETWORK

	* TABLE SCAN : TABLE DOES NOT HAVE INDEX. OR INDEX IS NOT BEING USED FOR QUERY EXECUTION.
			
	* INDEX SCAN : COMPLETE INDEXED DATA IS SCANNED / REFERENCED  FOR ACTUAL QUERY EXECUTION.

	* INDEX SEEK : REQUIRED INDEXED DATA IS FILTERED / SEARCHED FOR ACTUAL QUERY EXECUTION.


TYPES OF EXECUTION PLANS : AS SEEN FROM SSMS TOOL

			1. ESTIMATED EXECUTION PLAN
					APPLICABLE FOR SUCH QUERIES THAT NEEDS TO BE ANALYSED 
					WE DO NOT EXECUTE THE QUERY. BUT WE RETREIVE AN ESTIMATE OF 
					EXECUTION PLAN.

			2. ACTUAL EXECUTION PLAN
					WE CAN EXTRACT THE FINAL/ACTUAL EXECUTION PLAN AFTER QUERY EXECUTION.
					THIS IS THE EXECUTION PLAN FOLLOWED BY "QUERY OPTIMIZER".

			3. LIVE EXECUTION PLAN 	[NEW FROM SSMS 2016 VERSION]	
					WE EXTRACT THE ACTUAL EXECUTION PLAN during QUERY EXECUTION.
					THIS IS THE EXECUTION PLAN FOLLOWED BY "QUERY OPTIMIZER".			
					WE CAN MONITOR THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION / PERCENTAGE OF EXECUTION
					WE CAN ALSO COMPARE THE OPERATOR COST/QUERY EXECUTION STATS OF MULTIPLE QUERIES

HOW THE QUERIES ARE EXECUTED INTERNALLY?

	Query Parsing – Checking query errors and throw same

	After Query Parsing it performs algebrizer operation.
	Algebrizer  – 	The algebrizer resolves all the names of  the various objects, tables and columns, referred to 					within the  Query string.

	After Algebrizer  it performs The Query Optimizer
	The Query Optimizer – Optimizer generates EXECUTION PLANS, it compares them to previously generated plans in the 			      Procedure Cache.

	Query Execution
		Estimated and Actual Execution Plans
		LIVE Execution Plans

	Execution Plan Reuse  : the above generated plans are stored into Procedure Cache.



WHERE THE QUERY EXECUTION PLANS ARE STORED?

** 	PROCEDURE CACHE IS A MEMORY OBJECT. THIS STORES ALL EXECUTION STATISTICS. VOLATILE. 
	UPON SERVICE RESTART, THE PROCEDURE CACHE IS RESET. 


	WE CAN ALSO MANUALLY RESET THE PROCEDURE CACHE. 
		DBCC FREEPROCCACHE()   : DATABASE CONSISTENCY CHECK COMMAND

	


HOW TO CONTROL THE QUERY EXECUTION PLANS?
	
	1. DEFINE ACCURATE INDEXES

	2. ENSURE UPTODATE STATISTICS

	3. CONSIDER TO USE JOIN OPTIONS.

			MERGE JOIN

			LOOP JOIN

			HASH JOIN
