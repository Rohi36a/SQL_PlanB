AGENDA:

	MEMORY OPTIMIZED TABLES
	TEMPORAL TABLES
	LIVE EXECUTION PLANS

---------------------------------

MEMORY OPTIMIZED TABLES:
		
	A NEW TUNING TECHNIQUE INTRODUCED FROM SQL SERVER 2016
	USED TO "PRECACHE" THE TABLE DATA USING ADDITIONAL VM : VIRTUAL MEMORY

	THE OPERATIONAL DATA IS ACTUALLY RESIDING IN DATABASE FILES. 
	WE DEFINE ADDITIONAL MEMORY OPTIMIZED FILEGROUPS & FILES. THESE MEMORY OPTIMIZED FILEGROUPS & FILES
	WOULD LOAD THE DATA INTO MEMORY. MEMORY PERFORMS FASTER COMPARED TO ACTUAL DISK.
	
	THIS WAY, WE CAN ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE QUEIRES. 


	MEMORY OPTIMIZED TABLES : A MECHANISM TO CREATE ADDITIONAL MEMORY LEVEL REFERENCES FOR DATABASE TABLE DATA.

	WE PRELOAD THE DATA INTO MEMORY FOR FASTER SEARCH AND FASTER COMPUTATIONS, JOINS AND GROUPING & ROLLUPS. 


PRE REQUISITES FOR MEMORY OPTIMIZED TABLES:

	1. THE TABLE SHOULD HAVE A PRIMARY KEY
	2. PRIMARY KEY SHOULD BE NON CLUSTERED   = RESULTS IN INDEX KEYS FOR MEMORY LOADS
	3. A DEDICATED FILEGROUP IS REQUIRED TO STORE MEMORY DATA
	4. DATABASE SHOULD BE ENABLED FOR "MEMORY SNAPSHOTS"


STEPS TO IMPLEMENT MEMORY OPTIMIZED TABLES:
	
	STEP 1: DEFINE A FILEGROUP, MARKED FOR MEMORY OPTIMIZED DATA STORAGE
	STEP 2: ADD A FILE INTO ABOVE FILEGROUP
	STEP 3: ENABLE MEMORY OPTIMIZED SNAPSHOT ON THE DATABASE
	STEP 4: CREATE THE ACTUAL BASE TABLE : ENABLED FOR MEMORY OPTIMIZATION

			   WE ARE NOT LOADING ALL DATA INTO MEMORY.
			   NONCLUSTERED INDEX KEYS ARE LOADED INTO MEMORY. NOT ALL DATA.
